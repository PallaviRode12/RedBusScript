# From Missed Opportunity to Meaningful Growth 📚🐱‍🏍
In a recent interview, I was asked to write an automation script for the RedBus website. I wasn’t able to complete it at the time, and I realized I needed to improve in that area.
Instead of feeling discouraged, I took it as a learning opportunity. I started studying automation more deeply—practicing with real websites like RedBus, improving my skills in Selenium, and learning how to handle dynamic elements, waits, and XPath properly.

This experience taught me that failure is part of growth. I may not have succeeded in that moment, but it pushed me to work harder and become better. Now, I feel more confident and prepared for future challenges.🐱‍🏍🎇
